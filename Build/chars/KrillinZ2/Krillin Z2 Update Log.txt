-Plz reduce the hitpush on the 2nd hit of his st.SP. P2 now gets hit so far away, a cancelled-into Orin Combo will whiff.
--TWEAKED
-new Turtle Flip Throw looks cool, but there's still a little room for improvement I think. Can you let Krillin keep some momentum as he floats down after the kick? Right now he goes straight down, but imo he should also move slightly backwards (away from the opponent) so it looks like he's keeping some momentum from the flip.
--FIXED
-I saved the Kienzan charging looping sound from Krillin's file from FF3, and edited it. For some reason there is indeed empty space on both ends of the wave form. I deleted that and now it should loop fine and sounding good. https://vocaroo.com/i/s0wegCwSqlRr
--ADDED
-A sound to be added to his Forward Throw, as he starts firing the blasts (play just once) : https://vocaroo.com/i/s037uBOZoEWl

01/11/19

-Backwards throw is missing sounds (whooshes for p2 jabbing at Krillin and whooshes for both of Krillin's attacks.)
--fixed (I cannot match the opponent's anim with the woosh sound)
-Also in Backwards throw, his first punch needs to better aim for p2's headpos. When done on smaller enemies, he punches quite some inches above their heads.
--fixed
-His crouching Strong Kick needs to be redrawn, he gets comically larger during it and it looks plain bad.
--:shrug:
-I still feel he just shouldnt have that bar outside of Emo, it's confusing.
-Personally I'd get rid of his big aerial Lvl2 Kamehameha. That, or normalize the start-up for it (not copying the big slow lightning-charged build-up copied from Gokubros but just a normal Lvl2 Super Move super pause).
--Made it have typical LVL2 startup
