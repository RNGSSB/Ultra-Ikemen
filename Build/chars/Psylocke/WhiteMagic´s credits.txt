-v1.5-
--Changes from v1.4--
- Some rule and velocity changes so it's closer to MSH


-v1.4-
--Changes from v1.3--
- Changed her A.I. yet again...
- I think I got her air combos pretty good this time
- Added a Turns Mode intro
- Added Win Screen for end of match

-v1.3-
--Changes from v1.2--
- Fixed some velocities in her throws
- Changed her jump and Super jump velocities so they're exactly as in MSH
- Fixed annoying little infinite i wasn't aware about (thanks Snake)
- Fixed superjump so you can't charge it (and now you can use all three kicks as well) (thanks for bringing that to my attention Kung Fu Man)
- Made starting air combos a little easier
- Fixed some settings so that now she can combo a little easier while doing jumping attacks to a standing opponent

-v1.2-
--Changes from v1.1--
- Fixed some velocity issues
- Gave her a tan to make her less 'Simpson-esque'
- Added Transparencies
- Fixed A.I. a little so she's not as much of a cheap bitch

-v1.1-
--Changes from v1.0--
- Fixed some velocities on Maelstrom
- Fixed gethit velocities on standing low punch
- Changed some ctrl states so some super moves are truer to MSH
- Fixed some stray pixels in some sprites

-v1.0-
--What's Done--
- Just about everything (I think)

--What Needs to be done--
- Anything else you can think of ;D

You can host this character, just ask me first (WhiteMagic2000@hotmail.com)

Enjoy :-)
