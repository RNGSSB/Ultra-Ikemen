	+ The Death Wave hits the enemy;
	+ perform a Death Beam...
	+ but in the same moment (super pause) repeat the Death Beam motion (once or twice) or do the Death Ball one, or the Death Saw or the Tail Press Nightmare (second level); 
	+ doing so will not remove the Death Beam explod (it disappears if you do the Death Ball or another Death Beam but it won't go away if you do Tail Press Nightmare) and you will be able to waste all of your power.
- Close s.SP > s.MP is not possible anymore (gave more recovery time to close s.SP).

- Fixed Dancing Elbow infinite (Dash Elbow Infinite : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgZpbl8yw6w OR https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOjxtcy1csg) by putting a combo limiter. Performing it twice in a combo will make P2 fall.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
MEH & WHAT !!?
- Any reason why the first loop of the a.MK hits just once, but the second spin can hit twice? I'm not asking you to change it, because I like it.
? Once I was KO'd when running at someone, and it kept me frozen in the air! He MIGHT've hit me in the first frames of the f,f+SK. 
? after a launch, Death Wave > [medium punch, Death Wave] might be an infinite.
- Deathsaw keeps coming out when I try to use Deathbeam. I don't know if it's a coding thing, because I'm pretty good with my execution, but it's about 50/50 when I'm trying to use deathbeam, and I get the saw.
? Frieza's voice seems a bit low in comparison to the other characters. Especially on his counter command "After You" and Charging Elbow Attack.
? Counter could use some use such as countering a projectile (Like Wesker's counter from UMvC3)? It's an alright move, but leaves something to be desired.
? whenever you use Aerial Head Charge after his mid-air HP, when the enemy hits the ground they'll kind of be slightly inside of the floor, so to speak.
? Maybe another voice file for his air version of Death Wave? I have the feeling you'll be hearing it too often if it's for both air and ground versions...
? LVL 1 death beam does horrible damage. I understand it to be the weaker but faster of the LVL1 supers but just seems pointless with the current damage output. 
? (shouldn't be possible anymore to chain the 3) Three level 1 death beams do better damage than one level 2 + one level 1 death beam.
- Transformation sounds during the intro are not stopped if the intro is skipped! :P
- When you do his aerial head charge (even EX version) and switch side, when I try to follow up with a head charge or any move of that sort, the game registers it as I am still on the same side making me do a death wave, meaning I have to do the death wave motion (QCB) so the game registers it as a Head Charge (QCF) when I am switching side, after a few seconds (like 2) the game register freeza to have switched sides. Was is it meant to be like that or you're doing something about it?
- Death Saw can be beaten out by a single Ki shot? IDK just seemed wrong (Vegeta destroys it but not the other chars... WTF !!!!)
? (NAH, it's fine as is) Torture Gun doesn't give any superbar, only Sadism Bar. But, should it give some? Well, maybe not, his power charge isn't even disabled for Sadism Mode (not that it should, I'm just pointing it out).
? I do think we should rework the Z2 chars' intro's a little, everyone should have one 'silent' intro where they just stand or pose. Then when a character has a more 'talky' intro (our later Z2 characters have a lot of those),
it will automatically play the 'silent' intro for the other player. I assume it can be randomized if Player 1 or Player 2 has the talky intro. I like our intros but you can't make out anything when both have talky intros at the same time, and that's a bit of a shame. What do you think?
? Skipping his Transformation intro at certain parts will have sound effects (and really long ones too) playing over the start of the fight, please make sure ALL sounds playing during the transformation are instantly stopped as soon as the player presses Start to skip the intro.



NEW MOVES TO CODE :
- Finisher 3


FEEDBACK :

??? Quad EX Death Wave Combo! Ex Death Wave (launches), up to teleport), a.LP, a.MP, air EX Death Wave (bounce-juggles...but not always?), EX Death Wave (bounces/launches! again!), up to teleport, air EX Death Wave ! Somehow p2 won't bounce up from the 3rd EX Death Wave in the combo described above, if you put another LP Death Wave at the very beginning...weird! Must be some math stuff or something.

? On certain characters, Frieza can followup his j.HK even after he uses his groundbounce with st.LP (intentional?) (j.HK causes a hard knockdown due to the groundbounce limit. You can land and do st.LP before they hit the ground. And the infinite is very practical and can be used in a real match. The timing isn't hard once you get used to it.)

- The Frieza j.HK infinite has to do with whiffing any aerial special BEFORE the opponent lands. If it hits it obviously ends the infinite, but if it whiffs, he gets his groundbounce back on j.HK. Death Wave needs to be done right as the character is landing so that the groundbouncing animation makes them avoid the hit, while Head Charge needs to be done right when you use j.HK, though later into the loop you need to delay the j.HK, which is why using Death Wave is more optimal. Head Charge will only make it a loop. 

- EX Headbutt Corner Loop : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HP2iWhHiE0

- COMBO (In corner) : Launcher > J.LP > C.LP >Launcher > J.LP > C.LP > Launcher > J.LP > Launcher > J.HK > wait for bounce >Launcher >J.LP > AIR EX DEATH WAVE > DEATH BALL
	+ Alt. finishers! Scrap everything the last J.LP and do :
		S.LP > Standing EX. Death Wave > DEATH BEAM/DBB
		S.LP > Death Saw > J. Head Charge.
	+ Adding attacks (i.e. C.MK) before the first launcher is possible but affects the opponent juggle time greatly making the combo harder to perform.

- Elbow infinite at the end : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIxlTn5FEGg
- Corner infinite - based on smurfy's input : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=860s5aiO9rg


- Lv3 Death Ball : when p2 jumps over the Death Ball and it sinks into the ground, they will be 'sucked' to the wrong direction (the direction should change after they jump over/switch sides with the Ball)--> FIXED by XG

??? Pretty often, when performing the Emo Sadistic Dance, Freeza won't follow up with his Finisher! p2 will just be in his dizzy animation, and Freeza is fully controllable.  And it's not because he lacks a Lv3 Finisher, both times it happened the Emo bar wasn't filled up all the way.
- When transitioning from Round 1 to Round 2 when you have a full Emo bar, it will play the 'full power/bar is full' sound effect again, for no reason.
- Death Ball Lv3 with the slower hitpauses feels better, maybe add about 3 more hits to it? I feel it's not powerful (in terms of damage) enough for a Lv3.
- add a "oh my" variant to the soldier intro. voice is already used on his sadism activation
- Add sounds by Daeron ?


- Freeza soldier dancing intro: Would it be too much trouble to cut the boombox sprite into a few pieces, and apply your debries bouncing code to it and then after a short while have the pieces fade out, rather then the entire boombox lamely fading away in it's entiredy?

- Hmmmmmmrrrm honestly, the 100% Power winpose came out looking a bit weird, I'm not sure we should keep it, personally I could do without it.

- I feel all his non-EX Dancing Elbows need to come out a little faster. Even though it's not REALLY ment to be a combo move, comboing with the LK/MK versions is appreciated, and it doesn't work that well now unless you're standing (very) close. Having at least the LK version come out faster will make it a bit more useful.
- Move the muscled winpose to failure state (  for time over and continue screen!)
- Have the scream in the 1soldier death intro play a bit later and a red flash all over the screen just before they explode, to better transition, right now their legs kinda vanish without the explosion covering it.
- Add "not my final form" voice to golden freea winpose.


ICED IDEAS :
- Add rocks in the space for nova
- Earthquake sound for advancing : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaJNCxN9rXg


BALTHAZAR FEEDBACK :

4) When Frieza throws the Supernova, instead of the screen cutting to the next shot (with the sphere traveling), have the camera follow the Supernova from the beginning, right after Frieza throws it. This means you'll have to make the sphere drop down a little right after he throws it, so it's more centered in the screen before it starts hitting the soldiers.

6) Instead of the first soldier going black and then simply fading, is it possible to give him the Beam Death fading effect?

7)....it plays out with the black background VERY LONG, making it look pretty dull, anything we can think of to add to the background to make it a bit more interesting?


------------------------------------------------------------------
LV3 DEATH BALL IDEAS

? I think maybe a different superpause start-up frame will look better for Lv3. I'll need to see about that.
+ I wouldn't make the Lv3 ball even bigger, and I would keep Lv2 as it is as well.
+ hmmm maybe instead of one big explosion, a couple of explosions all around the ball can happen? So explosions would start to happen when the ball is still sinking. bam bam bam bam BAAAMM. Those smaller explosions leading up to the big final one might even pull p2 towards the ball if they hit.
+ Lightning during the charging sounds fine to me (i suppose you're talking about that chou khm lightning).
+ One last suggestion is to perhaps give the Lv3 death ball a red hue, so it's visably one step closer to the Super Nova.

Ok so most of these changes will only occur when the ball whiffs p2 and it's sinking into the ground.
For when the ball actually hits p2, how about instead of the hits dealing when they are standing, have the ball push p2 to the ground, then deal all the remaining hits on the ground, as if p2 is being squashed by the ball. P2 would display their falling impact sprite to act as 'on the ground' gethits.
