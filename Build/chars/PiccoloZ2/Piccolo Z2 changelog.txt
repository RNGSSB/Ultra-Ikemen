-Fixed issue where you could change colors after round 1 before fight
-Fixed issue where AI would sit there waiting for you to pick a color. 
 Now the AI doesn't wait at all so no issue fighting with other chars besides Piccolo.

-Can no longer air dash after a dash cancel into dash jump from SPx2. This prevents infinite hit and guard strings.
-Juggle points max out when you dash cancel from SPx2 so you cannot hit P2 
 while they are in a hit state. This prevents combos.

-cMP can hit on both side.
-sLP faster with more priority.
-cMK faster with slightly more priority.

-D Wave no longer vanishes once it hits so now it can take out multiple projectiles while active.

-Fixed bug where certain conditions could make Halo Stomp lock P2 in the air and not fall.

-Damage scaling begins on hit 3 now instead of 5.

-Made hit box of sMK a bit further out.
-Removed ability to hit with most attacks after using Punch Zetto counter.
-Made all hit boxes larger for his Zetto Counters. Making them MUCH more potent.
-Made it much harder to juggle with standing or crouching basics because now many don't make P2 rise anymore.

-Removed ability to juggle with most moves after strong DWave.
-MP Harpoon is fixed. The SP one I couldn't reproduce but it had the same issue as the MP one, 
 it was just harder to see. So I think I fixed it too.
-Mystic Harpoon buffed again by now dividing damage by 1.5 instead of 1.75.
 I'd missed a hitdef when applying the trigger that looks to see if the opponent 
 as hit by EX MHarpoon so the EX Harpoon loops are still possible with B+SP in the public build.

-Buffed Seeking Bullet:
-Damage scales less.
-If it misses or is blocked it waits longer before returning.
-On the way back if it hits a grounded P2 Piccolo can still hit them while it hits them. 
 He will only miss now if they are in a juggle state. These are pretty big buffs.

-Fixed a bug where you could still press attack buttons after winning with Hellzone Grenade 
 allowing you to see the attack while he still did his win pose.

-Fixed envshake of clones continuing when you skip their intro.

-Added ability to press start to select color when you have the color select option turned on in config. 

-Changed the dampening one more time.
-Finally for real fixed the slowdown issues with some attacks. 
  There was not a limiter on the combo limiter helper. So it was making SEVERAL the entire time it hit. 
   Special thanks to RawkHawk for checking this and telling me on Discord.
-Now if Piccolo hits a standing or crouching opponent it gives 1 dampening point. 
  Like before. But now if the opponent is in the air or OTG the attacks give 2 points.
-Things like Mystic Harpoon, Mental Shock, and others that gave you a HUGE increase in dampening points 
  when they connected no longer do. They do 1 point or 2 depending on the above.

-Fixed the Mystic Harpoon sometimes not grabbing.
-Decreased the amount Mystic Harpoon divides the damage after hit. Now instead of dividing in half it divides by 1.75.
-Took away 3 ticks of startup from Carnage Blitz.

-Special Beam Cannon command changed to QCFx2+P
-Clones disappear and reappear correctly during Hellzone Grenade.
-Clones now only take 150 life. Clone still has 200 life. 
 You can absorb them back and gain 50 life points. Minimum to create them is now 160.

-Color of aura fixed.
-Changed voice for back throw.
-Added envshake to the Clones Collision intro.
-Added transparency to ghosts.

-Combos begin dealing half as much damage once you hit P2 with Mystic Harpoon.
