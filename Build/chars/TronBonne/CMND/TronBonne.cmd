; the cmd File.
;
; two parts: 1. command Definition and  2. state entry
; (state entry is after the commands Def section)
;
; 1. command Definition
; ---------------------
; note: the commands are case-sensitive, and so are the command names.
; the eight Directions are:
;   B, DB, D, DF, F, UF, U, UB     (all caps)
;   corresponding to back, Down-back, Down, DownforwarD, etc.
; the six buttons are:
;   a, B, c, x, y, z               (all lower case)
;   in Default key config, abc are are the bottom, and xyz are on the
;   top row. For 2 button characters, we recommend you Use a and b.
;   For 6 button characters, Use abc For kicks and xyz For punches.
;
; each [command] section Defines a command that you can Use For
; state entry, as well as in the cns File.
; the command section should look like:
;
;   [command]
;   name = some_name
;   command = the_command
;   time = time (optional -- Defaults to 15 if omitted)
;
; - some_name
;   a name to give that command. you'll Use this name to refer to
;   that command in the state entry, as well as the cns. it is case-
;   sensitive (qcb_a is not the same as qcb_a or qcb_a).
;
; - command
;   list of buttons or Directions, separated by commas.
;   Directions and buttons can be preceded by special characters:
;   slash (/) - means the key must be held Down
;          egs. command = /D       ;hold the Down Direction
;               command = /DB, a   ;hold Down-back while you press a
;   tilde (~) - to Detect key releases
;          egs. command = ~a       ;release the a button
;               command = ~D, F, a ;release Down, press FwD, then a
;          if you want to Detect "charge moves", you can specify
;          the time the key must be held Down For (in game-ticks)
;          egs. command = ~30a     ;hold a For at least 30 ticks, then release
;   Dollar ($) - Direction-only: Detect as 4-way
;          egs. command = $D       ;will Detect if D, DB or DF is held
;               command = $B       ;will Detect if B, DB or UB is held
;   plus (+) - buttons only: simultaneous press
;          egs. command = a+b      ;press a and b at the same time
;               command = x+y+z    ;press x, y and z at the same time
;   you can combine them:
;     eg. command = ~30$D, a+b     ;hold D, DB or DF For 30 ticks, release,
;                                  ;then press a and b together
;   it's recommended that For most "motion" commads, eg. quarter-circle-fwD,
;   you start off with a "release Direction". this matches the way most
;   popular Fighting games implement their command Detection.
;
; - time (optional)
;   time allowed to Do the commanD, given in game-ticks. Defaults to 15
;   if omitted
;
; if you have two or more commands with the same name, all of them will
; work. you can Use it to allow multiple motions For the same move.
;
; some common commands examples are given below.
;
; [command] ;quarter circle Forward + x
