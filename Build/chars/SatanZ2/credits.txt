Jango's Special Thanks:

Balthazar, for making my code look good, and being a good friend.
Iced, who made me laugh and is probably the best boss I've had.
Jmorphman, who helped me with tons of code, and for fun times.
JustNoPoint, who helped give me the push to continue.

Priscilla, Donny, Lyra, and Bernadette
- My IRL friends who were there when I needed them, and had my back
  at all times. Your unconditional friendship and support gave me
  the courage to spread my wings and be proud of my work, both on
  and offline. You're the TRUE world champions!

And of course, YOU, the player. I hope you enjoy Mr. Satan!
