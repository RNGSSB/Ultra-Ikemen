10/10/2016

- Taunt: thought bubbles and food position changed. Winpose (I'm hungry): thought bubbles and food position changed.

- Added sound effect for hitting ground. (15000,1)

- Backward throw sound effect changed.

- Dragon Fist (1st attack) and EX Dragon Fist (3rd punch) have now lower guard hit times so he can be punished. Same thing for the Hurricane Kick (not the EX version).

- Kamehameha (ground, air) sound effect (charge) has been changed.

- Added easy_genki and easy_kaio commands (easy commands to shoot the Genkidama and to perform Kaioken).
	easy_kaio	= D,x+a (Down, Light Punch + Light Kick)
	easy_genki	= D,z+c (Down, Heavy Punch + Heavy Kick)
	They can be set in the config.txt file.

- Genkidama sound effects changed.

- Stupid bug with up Chou Kamehameha fixed; I fixed it on Gotenks but I made the same mistake on Goku! >_<

- Emotion system will be removed when and if the Kaioken rush supermove fails.

- Instead of explods, now the helpers use the sparkno in their hitdefs. This means that, although the hitsparks can't be scaled like before, there won't be problems regarding hitspark positioning (eg against Piccolo's clones).

- Kaioken workaround for Piccolo completed. Hey, before I mentioned Gotenks, maybe I'll have to take into account those ghosts of his.

04/10/2016

- Fixed the "I'm really hungry" intro against himself. You could jump before the intro roundstate finished, causing him to stand in the air. (state 746, changestate: it had ctrl = 1; changed to ctrl = 0)

- Removed the heart graphic in his "Catching Chichi" winpose. (state 700)

- Removed yellow effect for his Focus strike attack.

- Genkidama Kaioken rush fixed. Occasionally he would shoot ki blasts ad infinitum. So I added a varset at the start to fix it. Also fixed the sound effect playing ONLY when the Genkidama flies against the enemy, not when it hits the enemy.

- Slash Down kick (state 1100) can now be punished if guarded. (only tested against Goku Z2)

- Kamehameha white light effect removed on all Kamehameha moves.

- Added Kaioken aura to Kaioken Chou Kamehameha (upwards).


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03/10/2016

- Slightly extended red CLSN for s.SP. Also changed the ground.slidetime and ground.hittime to 20 and the ground.velocity to -7.7.

- Added twirl sound effect for his flip animations (Bicycle Kick, Meteor Kick, Super Meteor Kick).

- Fixed Zero Counter start up animation.

- Added workaround for Kaioken against Piccolo Z2.
	When he's alone (no clones), the Kaioken works like normal;
	When he makes clones, Goku does the Kaioken Kamehameha.
	I'll have to test it more (what if Goku does the Kaioken while Piccolo summons his clones?)

- Kaioken Kamehameha fixed.

30/09/2016

- Added sounds 2000,2 and 2000,10 as 2000,3 and 2000,11. Sounds not used, awaiting instructions.

- Changed reverse throw sound (with strong punch whiff sound) and added forwward throw sound (jumping sound effect).

- Changed authorname to "Team Z2".

- Added "My Toes!" sprites and animation. (number 5886)

- Added combo: c.SP -> EX Hurricane Kick.

- Reducing pausetimes (removing one unit on all hitdefs)
	Done: normals.cns, specials.cns, system.cns, supers.cns, helpers.cns
	I hope I haven't put the old infinite combos in the character when editing the pausetimes.

- Fixed head.pos.

- Not really needed or useful but fixed the sprite 20500,0 to spell Kaioken instead of Kaiyoken.
